                      <h6>Responsive Design:</h6>
                      <p>
                        Implementing responsive design ensures that a website adjusts and displays appropriately across various devices and screen sizes (desktops, tablets, smartphones). This is crucial for users with different devices and abilities to access and navigate the website seamlessly.
                      </p>
                    </li>

                      <h6>Accessibility Features and Compliance:</h6>
                      <p>
                        Incorporating accessibility features and adhering to accessibility standards such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) helps make the website usable for individuals with disabilities. This can include providing alt text for images, ensuring proper keyboard navigation, using ARIA labels, and maintaining color contrast for those with visual impairments.
                      </p>
                    </li>

                      <h6>Inclusive User Interface and User Experience (UI/UX):</h6>
                      <p>
                        Designing an inclusive UI/UX involves considering the needs and preferences of diverse users. This may include providing options for adjusting text size, choosing color themes (dark mode or light mode), and enabling language preferences. An inclusive UI/UX ensures that users with different abilities and needs can customize the interface to enhance their user experience.

                    <li>
                        <h6>Using of Bootstrap</h6>
                        <p>Bootstrap is an incredibly powerful framework, especially when it comes to creating responsive websites. It offers a rich library of amazing styles that are not only ready to use but also highly customizable to suit your specific design needs.</p>

                        <h6>Fetching data from an API </h6>
                        <p>
                            Utilizing an API as a data source simplifies the process of obtaining precisely what you require. This, in turn, facilitates the creation of your own website, minimizing the need to invest significant effort in building a custom database or backend project from scratch.

                        <h6>Handlebars Tool</h6>
                        <p>
                            When working with Handlebars, mastering the creation and utilization of partials is crucial for maintaining consistency throughout your project. Partial templates allow you to encapsulate reusable components, making it efficient to manage and apply consistent designs across various sections of your project. This approach streamlines development and ensures a cohesive and polished user experience.

                        <p>
                            Handlebars simplifies dynamic data display on websites by creating reusable templates with data placeholders. It separates data and presentation, enhancing code cleanliness and maintainability. This templating engine streamlines content rendering, making it effortless to display information dynamically, whether it's based on user input or database queries.

                        <p>
                            Consider integrating a backend server and database to dynamically fetch data instead of relying solely on a JSON data file. This allows for real-time data updates and a more interactive user experience.
